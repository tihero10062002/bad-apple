# Preface
A word of disclaimer, while the final code is somewhat original, this project is an amalgamation of different code snippets that I found online. As the main YouTube Video begins to gain traction, I feel the need to inform the audience that this code is NOT ENTIRELY ORIGINAL. 

The concept of playing Bad Apple!! on a Command Line Interface (CLI) is not a novel idea and I am definitely not the first. 

There are many iterations and versions around YouTube and I wanted to give it a shot. The intent of posting the video on YouTube was to show a few friends of a simple weekend project that I whipped up in Python. 

My own video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZfrXrk3ZHc).
